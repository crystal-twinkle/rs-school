## Functionality

- **Input and Verification:**
  - Users can enter CSS selectors in the provided input field and submit them for verification by either clicking the "Enter" button or pressing the "Enter" key on the keyboard.
  
- **Feedback Animations:**
  - The application provides visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers through animations. Correct answers trigger elements to fly off the screen, while incorrect answers result in a shaking effect on the code input window. 

- **Level Progression:**
  - When a user provides a correct answer, they proceed to the next game level. If they complete the final level, a victory notification is displayed.

- **Help Feature:**
  - Users can access a "Help" button for assistance when they are stuck. Clicking the "Help" button displays the required CSS selector in the code input window with a typing effect, revealing the text letter by letter.

- **Level Selection:**
  - A list of game levels is available, and users can click on a specific level to navigate directly to it. Each level is marked as completed, incomplete, or completed with the help of a hint. The current level is highlighted. The application remembers the last level even after a reload. There is also an option to reset progress and start the game from the beginning.

## Purpose
