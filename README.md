  - Users can enter CSS selectors in the provided input field and submit them for verification by either clicking the "Enter" button or pressing the "Enter" key on the keyboard.

The current level is highlighted. The application remembers the last level even after a reload. There is also an option to reset progress and start the game from the beginning.
